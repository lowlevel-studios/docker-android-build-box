# Docker Android Build Box


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lowlevel-studios/docker-android-build-box.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lowlevel-studios/docker-android-build-box)


## Introduction

A **docker** image that can be used to supply an **Android** build environment. This is based on the fabulous work by [Ming Chen](https://github.com/mingchen/docker-android-build-box) and [Conhea](https://github.com/Conhea/docker-android-build-box). So thanks goes to them for providing the base for this.

* Ubuntu 17.10
* Android SDK 22 25 26 27
* Android NDK r16b

* ConstraintLayout 1.0.1 1.0.2



## Docker Pull Command

The docker image is publicly available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/lowlevelstudios/android-build-box/) based on the Dockerfile in this repo, so there is nothing hidden in the image. To pull the latest docker image:

    docker pull lowlevelstudios/android-build-box:latest


## Usage

### Use image to build Android project

You can use this docker image to build your Android project with a single docker command:

    cd <android project directory>  # change working directory to your project root directory.
    docker run --rm -v `pwd`:/project lowlevelstudios/android-build-box bash -c 'cd /project; ./gradlew build'



### Use image for Bitbucket pipeline

If you have your Android project hosted on [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) and want to use a bitbucket pipeline to build your Android project, this docker image can do it for you.
Here is an example of a pipeline defined in `bitbucket-pipelines.yml`

    image: bohsen/android-build-box:latest

    pipelines:
      default:
        - step:
            script:
              - chmod +x gradlew
              - ./gradlew assemble


## Docker Build Image

If you want to build the docker image locally, you can use the following `docker build` command to build the image.
The image itself is up to 6 GB (can change significantly on every build if sdk components change), so check your free disk space before building it.

    docker build -t android-build-box .
